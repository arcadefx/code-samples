Below are two examples demonstrating a subset of library I developed for building video games. I left out the game engine with event/state handling, file handling, etc.

### Example 1.

Description:

Demonstrates string handling.

To compile do:
 gcc gdt_strings.c example.c -o example

To run it
./example

### Example 2.

Description:

Demonstrates bit fiddling and fixed point math. Useful for processors without a floating point unit.

To compile do:
gcc fixed_point.c -o fixed_point

To run it
./fixed_point

### Other lib handling modules:

Binary trees 
	gdt_btree.c	

Linked lists
	gdt_list.c
