# Practice Go Examples

A collection of common Go programming patterns and operations for learning and reference.

## What It Covers

This project demonstrates various Go fundamentals including:

### Data Structures & Iteration
- Range loops over slices
- Indexed loops for character access
- Byte slices and character manipulation
- Slice operations (slicing, appending)

### Sorting
- Using `sort.Slice()` with custom comparators
- Sorting integers in ascending order

### Custom Packages
- Importing and using local packages (`tools`, `phone`)
- Package-level functions and methods
- Constructor patterns

### String Manipulation
- String reversal using loops
- Character-by-character processing
